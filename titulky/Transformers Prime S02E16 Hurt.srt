Bulkhead, prepare for departure.
Raphael and Agent Fowler

will be your communications
and transportation hub.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,787
- Who is the fiercest among you?
- I am Hardshell.

5
00:00:15,855 --> 00:00:21,061
You will retrieve
something for me. Tox-En.

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,011
<i>You're carrying it?
I thought that stuff was toxic.</i>

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,943
Your Spark is mine, Wrecker.

8
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,010
<i>That's right, soldier.
Come on home!</i>

9
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,719
The Wrecker left me alive.
The last mistake he will ever make.

10
00:00:43,425 --> 00:00:45,676
No!

11
00:00:47,968 --> 00:00:50,853
<b>2x16 - Hurt</b>

12
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:08,267
Oh, yeah!

13
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,272
Hey!

14
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:18,046
Let me guess ...  you and Raf spend all
your drive time listening to chip tunes.

15
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:23,387
Well, it's been fun, but I'm
ready to get back to my

16
00:01:23,455 --> 00:01:27,025
regularly scheduled partner,
Bulkhe...  aah!

17
00:01:31,865 --> 00:01:35,102
Bulkhead, respond!

18
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:37,337
Bulkhead?

20
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:32,618
Bulkhead?
What happened?

21
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,120
Tox-En exposure, among other things.

22
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:38,124
Bulkhead has suffered a
complete systems failure.

23
00:02:38,193 --> 00:02:40,960
Hold on. Tox-En?

24
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:44,763
Help me get him into the
medical bay... now!

25
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,293
No!

26
00:02:55,294 --> 00:02:57,875
If I hadn't gone to New York ...

27
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,944
There's nothing you could
have done!

28
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:03,547
Hardshell sucker-punched the
big lug while he was down.
