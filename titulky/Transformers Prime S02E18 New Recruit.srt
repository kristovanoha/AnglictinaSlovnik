I don't care if Bulkhead

Except that it wasn't your plan.

Welcome to Earth, Smokescreen.

It's an honor to be here...
especially with you.

Now what? It's not like we can
just bring him back to base.

57

Wouldn't be the first time
an ally turned out to be a plant.

58
00:05:12,697 --> 00:05:16,780
I see that you received your
training from Cybertron's elite guard.

59
00:05:16,863 --> 00:05:18,405
True enough ...

60
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:21,363
though it wasn't more than
a boot camp by the time I joined.

61
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:24,113
I never even got a proper
graduation ceremony.

There was a war going on.

Hey, all I ever wanted was to be
a soldier, serve the Autobot cause.

64
00:05:29,488 --> 00:05:32,738
But what I got was
security detail at Iacon.

65
00:05:32,822 --> 00:05:35,113
The Hall of Records of all places?

66
00:05:35,155 --> 00:05:39,155
Optimus, do you not find
this highly suspicious?

67
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:43,655
Smokescreen, what was your
assignment inside the hall?

68
00:05:43,738 --> 00:05:47,947
Guarding Alpha Trion during what turned
out to be the final days of the war.

69
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,822
- You served under the master archivist?
- Eh, I wasn't thrilled at first ...

instead of kicking Con tailpipe.

00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,655
Sorry. But the big "A" turned out
to be a great teacher and a... true friend.

72
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:07,155
I mean, he was the one
who petitioned Halogen

73
00:06:07,156 --> 00:06:09,572
and the High Council
to make you a Prime.

74
00:06:11,863 --> 00:06:15,697

75
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,863
That's it?
That's all you need to hear

76
00:06:17,947 --> 00:06:19,697
before inviting him to the party?

77
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,947
If my former mentor shared
this information, it is because

78
00:06:23,988 --> 00:06:28,113
he considered Smokescreen
a trusted ally.

79
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,988
We haven't had somebody
new here since Wheeljack.

80

What's your story, Smoke?
Where'd you come from?

81
00:06:35,322 --> 00:06:38,155
How'd you get here?
How many blasters you packin'?

82
00:06:38,238 --> 00:06:42,322
So, these are the life-force
we're supposed to protect?

00:06:42,405 --> 00:06:45,863
- Are they all like this?
- Fortunately not...

84
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:50,780

with how you came to arrive on Earth.

In a Decepticon escape pod.

The main thrust of combat

from the Hall of Records,
so things had been pretty quiet.

Next thing I knew,
I'm hitting solid ground ... hard.

100

The Decepticon warship must have picked
up pod's beacon and guided it to Earth.

101
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,488

Alpha Ttrion's fate, after the fall of Iacon?

I wish I did. But that was
the last I ever saw of him.

 envisioned for myself... until now.

Smokescreen, I would suggest
that you take some time

115

to become acclimated
to your new surroundings.

An extremely rare and

Refined into fuel, it provides
the power of hyperspeed.

Furthermore, we Autobots live on

169
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,972
The Red Energon is mine, humans!

170
00:12:56,055 --> 00:13:00,763
For you are powerless in the
face of the mighty star...

171
00:13:00,805 --> 00:13:03,138
What?

172
00:13:04,472 --> 00:13:07,513
<i>Where is it?</i>

173
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,038
<i>Nope.</i>

174
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,513
How about that one?

175
00:13:16,597 --> 00:13:19,722
Eh, it's more Ratchet's speed,
don't you think?

176
00:13:20,805 --> 00:13:25,430
- Cement truck?
- Yeah, if I were a Constructicon.

177
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:29,138
Seriously, this is the best
your planet has to offer?

178
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:37,388
- No, but this is Jasper.
- I feel for you.

179
00:13:56,513 --> 00:13:59,722
Fowler couldn't have the
crane operator lower the thing?

180
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:02,513
The humans must have been
preparing to transfer the meteor

181
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:07,013
to a cargo ship when they
received his evacuation order.

182
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,805
<i>Run along home, Autobots.</i>

183
00:14:09,888 --> 00:14:14,763
That Red Energon has
my name all over it.

184
00:14:29,472 --> 00:14:34,763
And I am more
than willing to fight for it.

185
00:14:42,425 --> 00:14:46,967
Secure the Red Energon and have
Ratchet bridge it back to base. 

186
00:15:02,258 --> 00:15:08,175
Don't tell me you've already
forgotten our last encounter, Prime.

187
00:15:08,258 --> 00:15:11,925
Keep moving, B.

188
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:18,758
Optimus, is something wrong?

189
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,946
<i>Starscream has come for the Red Energon,</i>

190
00:15:22,947 --> 00:15:27,092
<i>and I fear he will not
be deterred in his quest.</i>

191
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:27,967
Starscream?

192
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,758
I heard stories about that
stiletto-heeled creep back on Cybertron.

193
00:15:31,842 --> 00:15:32,758
Send me in, Doc.

194
00:15:32,842 --> 00:15:35,675
When Optimus requires
backup, he will ask for it.

195
00:15:35,758 --> 00:15:38,342
Aw, come on.
I got my V-mode and everything.

196
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:41,008
- I'm souped up and ready to roll.
- Eh! Eh! Eh!

197
00:15:41,092 --> 00:15:46,425
What part of "further training"
did you not understand?

198
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:58,342
The higher you climb,
the harder you fall.

199
00:16:02,717 --> 00:16:04,383
[ laughs ]

200
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:08,592
Autobots ...
such slow learners.

201
00:16:08,675 --> 00:16:10,425
Optimus, what is your status?

202
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:13,925
Ratchet, they need me. 
I can do this.

203
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:17,342
Arcee? Bumblebee?
[ static ]

204
00:16:17,425 --> 00:16:21,717
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard, and I'm ignoring you.

205
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,425
This may be your opportunity
after all, Smokescre...

206
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:31,592
Where is Smokescreen?

207
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:39,633
- That's the one.
- You, there!

208
00:16:39,717 --> 00:16:43,425
What in the name of the Allspark
do you think you're doing?

209
00:17:00,342 --> 00:17:03,467
Time to unload some more deadweight.

210
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:13,717
[ screams ]

211
00:17:16,717 --> 00:17:20,967
[ grunting ]

212
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:21,967
No!

213
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,092
[ screams ]

214
00:17:37,425 --> 00:17:39,383
[ crash ]

215
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:41,300
[ growls ]

216
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:44,300
Watch your step, Autobots!

217
00:17:44,383 --> 00:17:46,592
[ laughs evilly ]

218
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,208
Huh?

219
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:09,958
Apparently, no one defined
"low profile" for him.

220
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,292
So, the Autobots have a new recruit.

221
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:26,625
And you must be Starscream.
I thought you'd be taller.

222
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,042
[ growls ]

223
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:32,958
- This will not end well.
- Smokescreen, stand down.

224
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:36,000
You are no match for
Starscream's Apex armor.

225
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:39,167
Any last words, Smokescreen?

226
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:43,542
Just four ... 
kiss your armor goodbye.

227
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,625
[ warbling ]

228
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:58,625
[ grunts ]

229
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:04,458
- A Phase shifter?
- Now, that was a plan!

230
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,792
[ sighs ]

231
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:10,125
[ sighs ]

232
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:16,625
You aren't the only one sporting
a fancy wrist-mounted device.

233
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:18,542
Think fast!

234
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,167
No!

235
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:01,542
Told you I just needed
to borrow it for a while.

236
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,958
Doc here thought I was
trying to steal your relics.

237
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,125
Only until you explained your
plan, which I then sanctioned.

238
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,667
It's called protocol.

239
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:14,000
Ratchet is correct.
Standard procedure must be

240
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:18,292
observed by every member of this team.

241
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,667
However...

242
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:24,167
I believe we must also
commend Smokescreen.

243
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,792
You have proven to be a quick study

244
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:31,292
by choosing to place
strategy above bravado.

245
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,333
There is gonna be no
living with him now.

246
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,958
While this may lack
the pageantry of a proper elite

247
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,125
guard ceremony, I wish to
welcome you to team Prime.

248
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:55,667
[ grunts ]

249
00:20:55,708 --> 00:21:00,833
The Newbie did all right.

250
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,750
Don't worry, Bulk.
He's got nothing on you.

251
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,458
Seriously, once we get that
leg of yours back in shape,

252
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,320
old Smokey's gonna learn real quick
who the top wrecking ball is run here.

253
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:24,292
Bulkhead?
